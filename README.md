# MLNETYolo3
Implementation of YOLOv3 object detector in ML dotnet using ONNX.
Includes support for YOLOv3-tiny (ONNX model included in the repo) and YOLOv3.

# The ONNX model
Was a pain in the ass to create, but was hacked together using this project (https://github.com/Rapternmn/PyTorch-Onnx-Tensorrt), with added support for MaxPool to support YOLOV3-tiny.

Ping me to get a copy of the YOLOv3 ONNX model. I've not managed to the the ONNx zoo version to work sanely with ML.NET.
